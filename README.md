🏧 ATM Simulation System (Core Python)
📌 Introduction

The ATM Simulation System is a menu-driven Python program developed using Core Python only.
It simulates basic ATM operations such as user authentication, balance enquiry, cash deposit, cash withdrawal, and transaction history.

This project is designed for academic submission and helps beginners understand real-world banking operations using Python.

▶️ How to Run the Program

Ensure Python is installed on your system

Download or clone this repository

Open terminal / command prompt

Navigate to the project folder

Run the program using:

python atm.py

🧑‍💻 How the System Works

User enters ATM PIN for authentication

If PIN is correct, ATM menu is displayed

User can:

Check balance

Deposit cash

Withdraw cash

View transaction history

Change ATM PIN

All transactions are stored in a list

User can exit the system safely

📊 Sample Output
----- ATM MENU -----
1. Balance Enquiry
2. Deposit Cash
3. Withdraw Cash
4. Transaction History
5. Change PIN
6. Exit
